# Day 024 Progress Log

This README summarizes the work done on Day 024, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Friday, September 05, 2025_

**Attendance:** _06:03 PM to approximately 04:30 AM_

## Tasks/Activities

- Worked on a pending ticket related to the DBT system; the decision was made to upgrade the platform base image instead of incremental fixes.
- Collaborated with Muhammad Ali Asad to resolve several bugs, then was re-assigned to a different task focused on efficiency improvements.
- Created a repository on the CoderzHunt GitHub profile for the *** database scraper project.
- Fixed reported bugs and added the requested features for OctaMD's Usama; shared the updated source code to replace his previous solution.
- Attended a training session on assessments conducted by Usama Lakhwera.
- [TODO]: Refactor the *** database scraper project structure into a scalable, documented one.

## Tools/Technologies

- DBT (Whitecap/DBT system)
- GitHub (CoderzHunt profile)
- Python / scraper tooling
- Collaboration tools and code review workflow

## Blockers

- Decision to upgrade the base image means the initial fixes were deferred until the platform image update is completed.

## Details

- After working through the ticket and debugging, an architectural decision shifted the approach to upgrade the platform base image. This will require coordinating the upgrade before finalizing the fixes.
- The *** database scraper project repository now contains the bug fixes and the new feature requested by Usama; the source code was shared with him to replace the prior implementation.
- Next actionable item: refactor the scraper into a modular, documented structure (listed in the TODO).
