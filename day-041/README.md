This README summarizes the work done on Day 041, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Sunday, September 28, 2025_

**Attendance:** _07:30 PM to 02:30 AM (**Overtime to meet team deadline despite overwhelming fatigue**)_

## Tasks/Activities

- Continued the extension development work from the previous day, further stabilizing UI and background utilities.
- Resolved several UI bugs and refined the form extractor to better handle edge cases.
- Continued implementing queues, dictionaries, and application-tab-management logic.
- Addressed remaining use cases for manual input saving and reusability.

## Tools/Technologies

- Browser extension tooling (background scripts, tab management)
- Cursor IDE
- React + TypeScript

## Blockers

- Memory leakage stemming from tab signal processing persisted and needs deeper diagnostics.

## Details

- Recreated and refactored parts of the extension to reduce complexity introduced by generated code and to make debugging easier. Continued prioritizing the memory leak fix as the top item for next iterations.

- **NOTE TO MYSELF**: You need to communicate better with your team about your health and workload. If you're feeling overwhelmed or unwell, it's okay to speak up and ask for support. Your team should understand and accommodate your needs. Don't hesitate to take breaks when necessary and prioritize your well-being. Remember, a healthy mind and body are essential for sustained productivity and success.
