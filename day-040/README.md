# Day 040 Progress Log

This README summarizes the work done on Day 040, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Saturday, September 27, 2025_

**Attendance:** _06:30 AM to 06:00 AM (**Overtime to meet team deadline despite fatigue and only small breaks**)_

## Tasks/Activities

- Continued development on top of a basic functional browser extension scaffold provided by a teammate.
- Enhanced the UI using Cursor-generated components (tabs, tables, etc.).
- Added a universal form detector and an auto-filler to improve automation across varied forms.
- Integrated APIs where applicable and implemented a basic tab and process manager.
- Implemented queues and dictionaries for managing processes, tabs, and form state.
- Extracted form fields for mapping to auto-fill logic, and added manual input saving for reusability (a few use-cases remain pending).

## Tools/Technologies

- Browser extension framework and background scripts
- Cursor IDE for UI generation
- React + TypeScript
- Tab and form management utilities

## Blockers

- A number of UI and logic bugs remain (approximately 5â€“10 components), with a memory leak due to improper tab signal handling being the most critical.

## Details

- Cursor-generated solutions were difficult to debug due to existing codebase workflow, so parts were re-created in a new extension instance to ensure reliability.
- Focus was on stabilizing core utilities (tab manager, application queues, form detector) before advancing the UI feature set.

- **NOTE TO MYSELF**: You could not maintain proper sleep cycles last week due to excessive overtime, stress, and poor diet. Despite that, you continued to push hard to meet deadlines without getting adequate rest. This proved detrimental to your health and productivity. You need to prioritize self-care and establish healthier work habits moving forward. And yes, you did exhaust yourself to the point of mental and physical breakdown. Learn from this experience and avoid repeating the same mistakes. Your health is more important than any deadline.
