# Day 039 Progress Log

This README summarizes the work done on Day 039, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Friday, September 26, 2025_

**Attendance:** _06:00 PM to 06:00 AM_

## Tasks/Activities

- Researched modern browser extension frameworks/SDKs (~20 minutes).
- Compared Plasmo and WXT using ChatGPT; chose WXT and started development (~10 minutes).
- Used Cursor IDE to generate initial Chrome extension scaffolding (~10 minutes).
- Migrated the existing React + TypeScript frontend into a Chrome extension (~1.5 hours).
- Created a GitHub repository for the extension and pushed starter code for the team (~10 minutes); no one has contributed yet.
- Focused on building utility/background functions and modularized the solution (3â€“4 hours).
- Implemented and documented tab management, applier services integration, and sample snippets.

## TODOs

- Filter out unprocessed tasks to test utilities against real targets (in progress).
- Build a conventional, user-friendly UI for the extension (currently using old frontend for testing).
- Enhance UX by saving user data and improving form detection for random forms.

## Tools/Technologies

- WXT (extension framework)
- Cursor IDE
- React + TypeScript
- GitHub
- Background scripts and tab management for extensions

## Blockers

- None reported; work continues on feature completeness and UX.

## Details

- The extension migration provides a path to integrate core applier utilities directly into the browser. Next steps focus on filtering job lists and improving robustness of form detection and data persistence for better user experience.
