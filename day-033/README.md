**DATE:** _Thursday, September 18, 2025_

**Attendance:** _06:10 PM to 05:00 AM_

## Tasks/Activities

### Platform

- Removed platform-specific scripts that were not portable and pushed the latest changes to the repository.

### Automation (Chrome extension)

- Added a query parameter to the target API endpoint to support concurrency control.
- Updated the Chrome extension so it makes a single API call; a Chrome instance now opens N tabs and starts processing in parallel.

## Tools/Technologies

- Chrome Extensions
- JavaScript/Node.js
- API concurrency controls
- Repository and version control

## Blockers

- None reported.

## Details

- The change to the target API endpoint simplifies the extension's behavior and reduces redundant API calls. Parallel tab-based job application was implemented to speed up bulk submissions.
