This README summarizes the work done on Day 045, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Thursday, October 02, 2025_

**Attendance:** _06:03 PM to 05:35 AM_

## Tasks/Activities

- Created missed migrations for entities that were generated when the backend was run.
- Designed the database schema for a Task Management module and revised SQL DCL and DML scripts for manual migration creation as instructed (no AI help).
- Created entities and repositories, then reverted and recreated enums, entities, and migrations after DB schema requirements were changed.
- Studied NestJS and TypeORM documentation to align entity and repository patterns.
- Currently rewriting entities, repositories, services, and controllers for the Task Management module.

## Tools/Technologies

- NestJS
- TypeORM
- SQL (DCL/DML)
- Database migrations

## Blockers

- None reported; schema changes required iterative work.

## Details

- The work focused on stabilizing the Task Management DB schema and implementing the backend scaffolding; next steps include completing the rewrite of entities/services and ensuring migration scripts are deterministic.
