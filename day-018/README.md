# Day 018 Progress Log

This README summarizes the work done on Day 018, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Thursday, August 28, 2025_

## Tasks/Activities

- The files shared with me were having bugs, so I had to collaborate with a peer to resolve those as changes were not from my side and the project did not have any Git history.
- helped another peer by configuring his development environment and demonstrating how using VS Code features and Git can boost productivity.
- assigned the software engineer intern the following tasks:
  - cloning an open-source project and running it on his local machine for development
  - JWT supported ExpressJS based NodeJS backed endpoints for user authentication
  - Material UI based ReactJS frontend project with REST APIs integrated
  - Postman collection of APIs with responses
  - Documented GitHub repository containing the above three deliverables

## Tools/Technologies

- GitHub and Git
- Postman

## Blockers

- [x] Managed to resolve the bugs related to file upload and redirection after authentication

## Details

- It was a boring and unproductive day given that I did not have any actual development tasks and new things to learn. Even the issues that I managed to resolve were simple and I collaborated with a peer to try multiple hit and trials to resolve those.
