## Details

- Out of curiosity, I tried scraping data that were being set through CSS using ::after in custom select (combo box) fields. However, I could not manage to do that in spare time.
- Besides that, file uploads on a target platform through automation were being rejected and that was probably the cause the frontend informed of the application being flagged as spam.
