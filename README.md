# Daily Progress Tracker

This repository is a personal log to track my daily work, learning, and blockers across multiple stacks and irregular tasks. Each day is documented in a separate file (e.g., `day-001.txt`, `day-002.txt`, ...), summarizing activities, tools used, and challenges faced.


## Convention for Daily Logs
Each daily folder (e.g., `day-001/`, `day-002/`, ...) must contain a `README.md` that follows this structure:

- **Tasks/Activities:** List what was done, learned, or practiced
- **Tools/Technologies:** Mention software, frameworks, or platforms used
- **Blockers:** Note any issues or challenges encountered
- **Details:** Add extra notes or context as needed

This convention ensures consistency and makes it easy to track progress across multiple stacks and irregular tasks. Refer to the example entries below for guidance.


## Example Entries
- **day-001/README.md:**
  - **Tasks/Activities:** Installed essential software (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, MiniKube, Slack, ThunderBird, Cursor, VS Code)
  - **Tools/Technologies:** Git, Docker, Kubernetes, MiniKube, Slack, ThunderBird, Cursor, VS Code
  - **Blockers:** None
  - **Details:** Set up Hostinger email, joined Slack/Team Jarvis, started Kubernetes crash course, practiced with minikube/kubectl

- **day-002/README.md:**
  - **Tasks/Activities:** Continued Kubernetes/MiniKube practice, attempted web scraping with Python (Selenium, Undetected Browser, Playwright)
  - **Tools/Technologies:** Python, Selenium, Undetected Browser, Playwright
  - **Blockers:** Cloudflare protection blocker on npidb.org
  - **Details:** Used undetected browser, could not bypass protection

## How to Use
- Add a new file for each day: `day-XXX.txt`
- Summarize your work, learning, and blockers
- Use this log to reflect on progress, identify recurring issues, and track multi-stack growth
