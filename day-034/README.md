# Day 034 Progress Log

This README summarizes the work done on Day 034, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Friday, September 19, 2025_

**Attendance:** _06:01 AM to 05:15 PM_

## Tasks/Activities

### Platform

- Performed a minor PR review to dynamically print OS information in the installation script.

### Automation / Job Applier

- Used Cursor to generate requested features and pushed the generated code to a new branch due to concurrency-related bugs.
- Manually fixed ~10 bugs focused on concurrency issues (transactions, race conditions, data flow).
- Completed 2 of 3 tasks assigned by my direct Team Lead, but later part of the day, Project Manager assigned 5 new tasks ignoring my assignments.
- Started refactoring the *** project with six planned features (1 pending, 5 new) to be delivered by Monday.

## Tools/Technologies

- Cursor (code generation)
- GitHub (branches, PRs)
- JavaScript/Node.js
- Concurrency debugging patterns (transactions, locks)

## Blockers

- Concurrency bugs required pushing generated code to a separate branch for further debugging and testing.

## Details

- I was unsettled by the Project Manager's explicit request to spend extra hours completing newly assigned tasks the same day. Although I often stayed late at the office to learn and work more, and delayed returning to the hostel until Fajr to avoid disturbing my roommate, his direct comment in Punjabi affected my mood. I had plans with peers that night, which were canceled due to his request, leading to an argument with both the Team Lead and Project Manager. Over the weekend, I decided to revisit the work to demonstrate best practices in project development.
