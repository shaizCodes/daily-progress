## Tasks/Activities

- Mentored a colleague on using the VS Code debugger to understand and debug code. Covered practical techniques: setting breakpoints, step into/over/out, inspecting variables, Call Stack, watches, conditional breakpoints, logpoints, and launch configurations.
- Paired with a teammate to review and debug their task; suggested fixes and small structural improvements.
- Attended a team meeting and listened to project updates and action items.

## Tools/Technologies

- VS Code (Debugger features: breakpoints, stepping, watches, call stack, launch configurations)

## Blockers

- None

## Details

- I did not have any tasks this day. I went around office asking senior developers if they had any tasks for me. One of the peers needed help with debugging their code, so I paired with him and helped him understand how to use the VS Code debugger effectively. Another peer needed help with a task, so I paired with him and we reviewed his code together, suggesting fixes and improvements. Then I joined a senior developer in his virtual team meeting to stay updated on a project progress and action items.
