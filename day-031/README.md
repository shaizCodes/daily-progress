# Day 031 Progress Log

This README summarizes the work done on Day 031, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Tuesday, September 16, 2025_

**Attendance:** _06:12 PM to 05:21 AM_

## Tasks/Activities

xxx
- Continued R&D on the Purple Llama image and attempted to install stack components (Dremio and Supabase).
- Faced a K9s configuration issue while managing clusters; resolved the issue and proceeded with testing.

xxx
- Created a Chrome extension with a single-page configurable UI for setting parallel processes count and user profile ID.
- Pushed the extension code to GitHub and opened an issue for concurrent execution of job application submissions.
- Documented 2â€“3 files using JSDoc and added TODO comments for the planned refactor.
- Reviewed the automation service responsible for Chrome instances and application submissions; researched better alternatives.
- Implemented a sample Chrome session manager to keep track of browser instances (work in progress; requires testing).
- [TODO]: Continue work on maintaining Chrome instances, multiple tabs, and robust failure handling so users can manually fill form sections automation fails to fill.

## Tools/Technologies

- Purple Llama image, Dremio, Supabase
- K9s (cluster management tooling)
- Chrome Extension APIs, JavaScript
- JSDoc for documentation
- Chrome session management (automation)

## Blockers

- The Chrome session manager is incomplete and requires further testing; robust failure handling is pending.

## Details

- K9s config error was resolved by updating cluster context and configuration files, and running `sudo /path/to/k9s`.
- The Chrome extension provides a lightweight UI for configuring parallelism and profile selection; next steps include implementing concurrency-safe form submission and more resilient browser instance management.
