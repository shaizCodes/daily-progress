## Details

- I did not contribute directly in any project, and my task of the day was just counting the number for maximum number of retries the project needed. Bad day in terms of progress I would have made.
- Wonderful day in terms of sharing knowledge and helping a peer to learn new things. The best part was he did not complain at all and attentively watched how Chrome Developer tools can be used to boost productivity. I showed him how to use element selector, console, networks, etc. Taking element screenshot, clearing console, reading HTTP requests and responses, were a few things he adapted really well. Amazing day!
