**DATE:** _Thursday, August 29, 2025_

## Tasks/Activities

- resolved bugs related to OAuth tokens, redirection, and automation

## Tools/Technologies

- VS Code (Debugger)
- Git and GitHub
- 

## Blockers

- There are improperly scrapped labels in some web pages which get missed in automation. A ticket should be created for that.
- The current OTP input is poorly implemented and can be optimised. A ticket is need for that too.
- The authorization redirection should be through a new tab rather than a new browser instance. Another ticket to be created.

## Details

- Best day so far as I received my first complaint from a disappointed teammate. His concerns were with delivery and my reason was not having any challenging technical task and any authority. Finally, after clear communication, I was excited for the challenges and were assigned 5 tasks out of which I completed 4. I requested for a few more tasks, and for authority to refactor the complete project if possible.
- An amazing day as I get to learn new things. I set up Google APIs for OAuth and configured it to use stored credentials if any. I used VS Code debugging tools, and loved the debugging experience. I look forward to seeing more development and bugs now. I look forward to more such experiences.
- Surprisingly, I wrote just 4 and deleted around 10 lines to resolve the bugs assigned to me.
