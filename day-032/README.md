# Day 032 Progress Log

This README summarizes the work done on Day 032, following the daily log convention defined in the root README.

**DATE:** _Wednesday, September 17, 2025 (***Laptop issues proving fatal***)_

**Attendance:** _06:00 PM to 05:00 AM_

## Tasks/Activities

- Troubleshot the Windows machine assigned to me that was automatically shutting down; issue likely caused by device driver acting as an overheating countermeasure.
- Reported to the admin and he reset up the machine with latest updates and drivers.
- Set up the development workspace again on the same machine with Git, VS Code, Cursor, Postman, Node, Python, and other recommended tools and extensions.
- Attempted to assist Umar Farooq in his task, but could not help much due to slow internet. 

### Platform Installation Script

- Incorporated a change into the installation script to print "Unsupported Operating System" when run on an OS other than Oracle Linux or Ubuntu.

## Tools/Technologies

- Git, VS Code, Cursor, Postman, Node.js, Python
- Shell scripting (installation script)

## Blockers

- Slow internet connection limited ability to assist Umar Farooq.

## Details

- The Windows machine required driver-level troubleshooting; after updates and configuration changes the automatic shutdowns ceased/mitigated temporarily.
- The installation script improvement helps avoid misconfiguration by explicitly checking OS compatibility and printing a helpful message for unsupported systems.
